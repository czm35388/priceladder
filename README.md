# Priceladder

The "priceladder"-project generates a GUI for parties.

The purpose of the application is to animate the common party people to drink with special drink prices.

Therefor a GUI was created, the surface shows for example 5 counters. With puhsing the 'Start'-Button the first Countdown begins to run. It runs until the defined time is over. Now the second Countdown runs.

At the moment, the Background of the surfache is a static jpg of the user. Also the values of the countdowns have to be edited manually within the c++ code.

For this purpose it would be the best, if the user of the application could edit the basic-settings within the running application.

If you want to join this project, be free and fork or branch it. I will always be thankful for every comment ;)

Much fun and don't trink to much...
