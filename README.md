# Priceladder
The "priceladder"-project generates a GUI for parties.

The purpose of the application is to animate the common party people to drink with special drink prices.

Therefor a GUI was created, the surface shows for example 5 counters. 
With puhsing the 'Start'-Button the first Countdown begins to run. 
It runs until the defined time is over. 
Now the second Countdown runs.

At the moment, the Background of the surfache is a static jpg of the user.
Also the values of the countdowns and the size of the application have to edit manually within the c++ code.

For this purpose it will be best, if the user of the application can edit the basic-settings within the running application.

So far, if you want to join this project, be free and fork or branch it. 
For all comments I will be thankful ;)

So much fun and don't trink to much...
